Indicate for each letter sequence whether it is a word you know or not. The test takes about 4 minutes and you can repeat it as often as you want (you will get new letter sequences each time). If you take part, you consent to your data being used for scientific analysis of word knowledge. Do not say yes to words you do not know, because yes-responses to nonwords are penalized heavily!"
